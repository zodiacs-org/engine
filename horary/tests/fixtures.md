# Foundation fixture derivations

All question instants and coordinate pairs are invented. No expected
astronomical value is obtained by running the engine or Swiss Ephemeris.

`questionInput` in `fixtures.ts` uses the UTC instant at noon on the first day
of January in the year 2000, at an invented location. Its lost-object label is
caller supplied and its quesited house is explicitly declared. The foundation
does not make any traditional house assignment from that label.

The calendar expectation in `input.test.ts` is calculated independently:
from the Unix epoch to the start of the year 2000 there are thirty ordinary
year lengths plus seven leap days, or `30 * 365 + 7 = 10957` days. Adding half
a day and multiplying by `86400000` milliseconds gives `946728000000`.
A `+02:00` offset at 14:00 and a `-05:00` offset at 07:00 identify that same
noon UTC. The date-only form identifies midnight, half a day earlier.
The fractional-second fixture adds the literal decimal milliseconds to noon.
These are calendar normalization checks, not ephemeris accuracy evidence.

`schematicChart` is a hand-written plumbing fixture, not the sky at the
question instant. Its Ascendant is 15 degrees in Aries; the Descendant adds
180 degrees. Its Midheaven is 285 degrees and the opposite angle is 105
degrees. Whole-sign cusps start at Aries and add 30 degrees for each house.
The body longitudes start at 10 degrees and increase by a sign for each row,
so their degrees within each sign remain 10. Speeds are arbitrary binary
fractions in degrees per day; Jupiter's negative speed is paired with a
retrograde flag. The empty aspect list and pinned zero clock are deliberate
placeholders. `cast.test.ts` checks that the wrapper forwards this fixture,
including metadata, without constructing numerical positions itself.

`cast.integration.test.ts` uses real engine calculations only for delegation
and structural invariants: the requested/actual house system, whole-sign
spacing, valid longitude and speed fields, and preservation of coverage and
polar-fallback flags. Its high latitude forces the engine's documented
Placidus fallback. Its pre-reference instant exercises the documented
coverage flag. No result is recorded as an independent sky reference.
