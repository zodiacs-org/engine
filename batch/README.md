# Batch compute workspace

This private project is the batch service under development for this engine
checkout. The completed work is checked off in [PLAN.md](PLAN.md). The current
implementation validates job definitions and counts their result rows; it does
not yet submit or execute jobs. Queue backends, workers, recovery, streaming,
HTTP, CLI and scaling measurements are later milestones.

All project files stay here. The engine source, npm package and carried archives
are unchanged. Code and documentation in this folder use the repository's
[MIT licence](../LICENSE). Consuming or redistributing the engine still requires
its [licensing and attribution terms](../LICENSING.md).

## Development

Use Node 22 with the runtime range declared in [package.json](package.json):

```sh
cd batch
npm ci --ignore-scripts --cache .cache/npm
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

Dependencies and the lockfile belong to this directory. Typechecking emits
nothing. Vitest runs only `test/` here and keeps its cache in `.cache/`.
Generated code belongs in `.generated/`, runtime databases and exports in
`.runtime/`, and raw benchmark output in `.generated/`; these paths are ignored.
Keep committed benchmark evidence compact and link it to its runner.

The contracts use a type-only relative import of the engine's public birth
vocabulary. This requires no engine build or runtime dependency. For the engine
execution milestone, bundle the relative engine source with dependencies
resolved from this project's installation and write only to `.generated/`.
An unbundled root source import cannot find dependencies installed only here.

The repository's `npm run package:contents` check requires an existing engine
`dist/`. If it is absent, record the missing prerequisite; do not run the root
build as part of this project. An npm pack dry run with scripts disabled can
still confirm that `batch/` is excluded from the engine's package.

## Job definitions

Import `parseJobJson` or `validateJob` from [src/index.ts](src/index.ts).
`parseJobJson(text)` checks the UTF-8 byte budget before JSON parsing;
`validateJob(value)` handles already-parsed data, so it applies row and task
budgets but cannot enforce an original request byte count. Both return
`{ spec, totalTasks }`, a deeply frozen snapshot independent of caller objects.
`spec` fills birth defaults and normalizes timestamp fractions, without
reordering input rows. No astronomy is computed during validation.

This example uses invented data and matches the charts schema:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "kind": "charts",
  "births": [
    {
      "id": "synthetic-a",
      "birth": {
        "utc": "2001-02-03T04:05:06Z",
        "latitude": 12,
        "longitude": 34,
        "houseSystem": "whole"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

| Kind | Required fields in addition to `version` and `kind` | Result row count |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `charts` | `births`, a nonempty array of `{ id, birth }` | Input birth count |
| `transit-grid` | `births`, `start`, `end`, `stepMs` | Birth count multiplied by sample count |
| `synastry-matrix` | `people`, an array of `{ id, birth }` with distinct members | N multiplied by (N minus one) |

For a transit grid, samples are `start + k * stepMs` while strictly before
`end`. The start is included; the end is excluded even when aligned to the
step. The step is a positive safe integer in milliseconds, independent of
calendar days or daylight saving. End must be later than start. A synastry
matrix is directed: both `(a, b)` and `(b, a)` are included and self-pairs are
excluded. The engine's labels and tie ordering depend on argument order.
Enumeration will use input order, birth first then time for a grid and row
first then column for a matrix.

Births accept only `utc`, paired `latitude` and `longitude` in degrees,
`houseSystem`, and `timeKnown`. Omitting the settings means `whole` and `true`.
The supported house names come from the engine's `HouseSystem` type. Instants
must use `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss[.sss]Z`, with optional fractional seconds up to
millisecond precision. Valid fractions normalize to milliseconds. Date-only
strings, numeric timestamps, Date objects, offsets, expanded years and local
wall times are not accepted by this transport. Resolve local times before
submission. `timeScale`, `deltaT` and input flags are not part of this schema.
An unknown birth time still requires an explicit reference instant and
`timeKnown: false`.

Validation checks calendar and clock fields, coordinate bounds, boolean and
house settings, unique ASCII identifiers, known fields, and dense JSON arrays.
Identifiers are case-sensitive, start with an ASCII letter or digit, and then
contain only ASCII letters, digits, dots, underscores, colons or hyphens.
It rejects explicit null or undefined settings. JSON parsing follows
`JSON.parse`, including its handling of repeated object keys. Calendar-valid
input is not a guarantee of ephemeris support or astronomical accuracy; the
engine's calculation checks remain necessary at execution time.

Limits are exported as `DEFAULT_LIMITS` in [src/model.ts](src/model.ts).
Callers may override `maxInputBytes`, `maxPeople` and `maxTasks` with positive
safe integers. Workload arithmetic uses integers before comparing the result
with the budget; no expanded work-item array is allocated. `totalTasks` counts
output rows, not engine calls or predicted execution time.

Invalid JSON or ordinary data input throws `JobValidationError` with `code` and `path`.
Codes are `invalid-input`, `unsupported-version`, and `limit-exceeded`.
Messages contain schema paths and fixed descriptions, without submitted IDs,
birth values or JSON parser text.
In-process proxies are executable caller code; their reflection traps may run
and throw their own errors. Use the JSON entry point for transport input.

The synthetic cases in [test/validation.test.ts](test/validation.test.ts)
enforce these schema rules, workload counts, default budgets and boundaries.
They test the wrapper's behavior and make no astronomical accuracy claim.
