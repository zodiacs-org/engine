# Scaffold validation

Session checks used Node 22.22.2 through a local npm exec runtime.

- `npm ci`: passed using the committed lockfile.
- `npm run check`: typecheck, Vitest and build passed.
- `test/scaffold.test.ts`: SDK handshake and synthetic natal receipt round-trip passed.
- `test/isolation.test.ts`: parent engine dry-run pack manifest excludes `mcp/`.
- Dependency audit from `npm ci`: no reported vulnerabilities.
- `git status --short`: changes confined to `mcp/`.

The parent `npm run package:contents` command was attempted and failed because
this checkout lacks `dist/calc.d.ts`. No parent build was run: the task requires
leaving `dist/` untouched. The dry-run pack isolation test passed independently;
it does not substitute for the engine's build-dependent size/content gates.
